# newer coffea versions use the vector library in a suboptimal way:
# when loading only the pt column of a "vector" array, the field cannot be accessed
# since a check is in place to ensure that the three other columns (eta,phi,mass)
# are present as well; however, we might not need them yet still cannot access pt;
